# Web-Components 🕸️
On a mission to build web components without using any css frameworks 🚀


### Why no flashy frameworks?
* CSS libraries are great if you need to release your project quickly.
* Lots of unnecessary CSS might bloat up the web app.
* Difficult to apply your own styles
* Updates in the frameworks might cause the code to break in the future. 💀
